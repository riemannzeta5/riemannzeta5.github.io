# Expository Series

This site hosts my expository series, which I generally publish incrementally.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages vs WordPress

The reason for this is that for such series, the section titles, organization, etc. could change often during writing/development, which is not the most well-suited to a blog publishing format. (On WordPress, changing previous post titles would break many blog features like new-content notifications for followers and auto-shares for people following my blog on other platforms.) Instead, the blog format is great for continuous discussion where the whole "mind's journey" can be chronicled -- e.g., a topic where it makes sense to publish follow-up posts saying "EDIT: this is what I've learned now" or "EDIT: this is what I think now" and continue on. This doesn't work as well for something like an expository series.

Another reason to host expository series outside WordPress is that a typical format for such series (in for example subjects like math) is PDF, which would be a better format than say HTML to avoid changing URLs in backward-incompatible ways later on. (Unless we have one giant HTML page for the whole series, which could introduce its own complications.) Then, this entails hosting media, which as I discussed in the repo's README is better on GitHub Pages than on WordPress.
