# Textbooks

I publish my textbooks in-progress and incrementally. (They are very large projects!)

For these projects, the section titles, organization, etc. could change often during writing/development. It is better to have one link to the content that doesn't change, so if we tried to say have each section be its own HTML page, then that could involve changing URLs often in backward-incompatible ways. But having one giant HTML page for the entire textbook could introduce its own complications, e.g. performance-wise. Traditionally, the default format of textbooks, especially in subjects like math, is PDF, and it is easiest when exporting from Overleaf/LaTeX to just do so as PDF. Thus, I develop my textbook projects in PDF format.

In terms of choice of hosting platform (GitHub Pages vs WordPress), this means we are hosting media, which as I discussed in the repo's README is better on GitHub Pages than on WordPress.
